## A Net of Webs, a Cyber Dream ##

Upon the wires that hum and gleam,
Where circuits pulse and voices scream,
In digital realms, we dare to tread,
Yet still, the world remains unsaid.

What fickle beast, this net-bound link,
That draws us in, and makes us think!
Though screens may shine, and bytes may fly,
What truth within do we deny?

O swirling dance of light and code,
Thou hast beguiled both young and old.
Each click, a step, a fleeting call,
That leads us far—yet does not stall.

Thine interface dost offer me
A thousand paths, but none set free.
For every page doth hide a snare,
A fleeting joy, yet empty air.

Let not thy sway o’er me be cast,
For though it beckons, I must pass.
To wander through the webs we weave,
Is but a dream we dare to leave.
